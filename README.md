# BasilClient

## Getting Started

To start the BasilClient, follow these steps:

### 1. Install a Java Code Editor
First, you need to download and install a Java code editor. We recommend using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) as it is widely used and well-supported.

### 2. Set Up the Workspace
Once you have Eclipse (or your preferred Java editor) installed, follow these steps:

- Open Eclipse.
- Select `BasilClient/eclipse` as your workspace. This will load the project into the editor.

### 3. Run the Client
After the workspace has loaded successfully, you can start the BasilClient by running the appropriate main class or configuration.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during setup, ensure that:
- Your Java environment is correctly configured.
- The project dependencies are correctly imported into Eclipse.
- The correct main class is selected when attempting to run the client.
